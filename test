Atop a large, ice-covered plateau,
 a struggle
 for survival is occurring. Two groups of mechanical 
                            creatures -- Chompers and 
Lobbers -- are battling to control this square,
                 slippery field for reasons that are beyond human 
comprehension.

However, the Lobbers believe that you,
 The Programmer
 knows what you are doing
and have decided that you will instruct them in their activities
    during
        this
            fateful
                day.
